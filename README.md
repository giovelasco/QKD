# Simulation and Detection of Attacks on the BB84 Protocol using Qiskit and Machine Learning

This repository was made to store the codes used simulate the BB84 Protocol using Qiskit and Qiskit-Aer, which was made as an Academic Collaboration between
Brazil and Czech Republic in the UNIGOU Remote Program. The scientific article related to this analysis can be found in incbac.

To run the codes present in this repository, you can usa Google Collab, Jupyter Notebook, VS code or other plataform that supports the extension .ipynb.
You can install qiskit ans qiskit-aer by running the cells presented in the InstallQiskit.ipynb.

I hope the article and the simulation were helpfull to help you undertand how to the BB84 protocol works and how to use Qiskit.
